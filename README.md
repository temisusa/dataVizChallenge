Data Viz Hack: Seeing Expert Connections

Challenge: Given a csv with experts and their publications, seek insightful and engaging ways to visualize the networks created by co-publishing.


There are two files, the full data set (millions of records) and a smaller subset (20k records). The subset may be easier to work with due to the smaller size, but feel free to trim that down further or use the entire database, as needed.


CSV header: `"documentId", "authorId", "authorName", "authorAffiliation", "authorCountry", "pubDate"`

Some background information about the data: It's a sample of our MEDLINE database, along with expert names. The names have been anonymized. The sample takes all of our records with a publication date of May 1, 2016 and beyond.

Note -- These images are just for illustrative purposes, feel free to be as creative as you wish. Based on feedback, we've added an additional field called "pubDate" so that your visualizations can have an additional dimension, if desired.
